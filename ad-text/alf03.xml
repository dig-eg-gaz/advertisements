                <head>A GOOD START IN LIFE.</head>
                <p>Mothers should early realize how essential good health is for the success of
                    their child in after life. A badly nourished baby generally means an undersized
                    child, wanting in stamina and vigour. If unable to nurse your baby you must give
                    the substitute that most closely resembles human milk. No farinaceous or starchy
                    food or unmodified cow's milk is permissible to a child under 6 or 7 months of
                    age. The "Allensburys" Milk Foods are so prepared as to remove the difference
                    between cow's milk and human milk, and they are as easy of digestion as the
                    natural food of the child.</p>
                <p>The "Allenburys" Foods are alike suitable for the delicate and robust, and, when
                    used as directed, form the best means of rearing a child by hand. The No. 1 Milk
                    Food may be given alternately with the mother's milk without fear of upsetting
                    the child or causing digestive disturbance. The dreaded process of weaning is
                    thus made easy and comfortable both to the mother and child.</p>
