                <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are Intended
                    to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from Cairo, every

                    per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about twice a
                    fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at Malta or
                    Marseilles.</p>

                    Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for Calcutta,
                    fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port Said.</p>
