                <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                    Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                    for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                    proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                    Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>
                <p>Information as to tickets, trains, etc., may be obtained of Messrs. Thomas Cook
                    &amp; Son, Egypt, or from the General Manager Railways, Famagusta. G. BERT DAY,
